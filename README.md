Reliance Industries Stock Prediction Using Linear Regression

Predicting Stock Market using Linear Regression

I am using dataset of Reliance Industries and I have also attached the dataset to my repository.

    RELIANCE.NS.csv
    
After importing dataset i had my dataset because it has some na values in it. After that i have reseted my index value with Date column of my dataset.

I personally think that to work with date and as specially putting date in model to fit is really tough. then i have converted my dataset to 1 dimension. 

Finally i have split my data using sklearn train_test_split and fited the model and plot it in using scatter plot.

    Mean square error is 118.829787....

    Model Score is 77%.

I have also attached the Scatter plot image.
